				<h2>Profile</h2>
				<p>I am a creative web developer</p>
				<p>I am a web developer with a "can do" attitude towards learning and problem solving. I find web development fun and challenging. I love being able to visually see the results of my code and designing pages that communicate character. I am an independent thinker and enjoy working on projects in a team environment or on my own. I am also a bit of a health nut and like being physically active.</p><br>
